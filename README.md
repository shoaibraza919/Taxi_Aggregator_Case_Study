# Taxi_Aggregator_Case_Study

This project is the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on New York City's yellow taxi market. The challenge is provided by Fast Cars, a cab agglomerator like Uber and Ola. They are going to launch their product in New York City. We are tasked to understand the new york taxi market before their product launch. 

## Setup

The whole code is in the file EDA_Taxi_Data.ipynb. I have provided the google drive links to data in the file Data_Links.txt as the csv files were too big to include in the repo.

## Background Information

I have taken following steps in this project to complete the EDA:
* Dropped unnececssary columns
* Added new columns that could add value
* Extensive cleaning of data i.e removing Nans and bogus data
* __Univariate Ananlysis__ of Continuous and Categorical variables
* __Bivariate Analysis__ between important variables that could lead us to new insights.
* Provided in-depth analysis of data 
* Recommended solutions which can be beneficial to the organization
